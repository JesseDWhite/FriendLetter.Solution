<h1>Hello From @Model.Location</h1>
<p>Dear @Model.Recipient,</p>
<p>How are you? I hope that you are having a nice weekend. I'm vacationing in the @Model.Location while I learn programming! </p>
<p>@Model.Recipient, you would not believe how cold it is here. I should have gone to Hawaii instead.</p>
<p>But I like programming a lot, so I've got that going for me. </p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you soon. I'll bring you back a souvenir. </p>
@{
  @* if (Model.Souvenier.GetType() == typeof(string) && Model.Souvenier.GetType() != null) *@
  string str = Model.Souvenier;
  if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(str))
  {
    <p>Here are some items that I will bring back with me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>@Model.Souvenier</li>
    </ul>
  }
  else
  {
    <p>I will not bring you anything back you greedy butt.</p>
  }
}

<p>Cheers,</p>
